# VR 3D Digging Simulator

## Project Description
This is a **VR 3D Digging Simulator**, inspired by [A Game About Digging A Hole](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/), built entirely from scratch by **Anusheel Soni**. The project demonstrates a **VR digging mechanic**, where the player can choose their path, dig, and create caves in a 3D world, offering an interactive and immersive experience.

## Features
- **VR player movement and locomotion** system for fluid and intuitive navigation.
- **Shovel interaction**:
  - The player's right controller is equipped with a **shovel**, interactable via button press.
  - **Shovel digging mechanic** where pressing the button allows the player to excavate mud in contact with the shovel.
- **Mud terrain generation**:
  - Dynamically created terrain that the player can dig through.
  - **Customizable mud dimensions, depth, and density** via the inspector window for flexibility in terrain configuration.
- **Cave creation** through digging, with the ability to walk and explore within the created caves.
